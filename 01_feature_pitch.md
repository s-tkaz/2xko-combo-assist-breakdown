# Feature Pitch – Dynamic Combo Assist System

## Player Problem
New players often struggle to execute long tag combos, leading to frustration and early churn. High execution skill gap can prevent accessibility and fun.

## Proposed Solution
Introduce a **Dynamic Combo Assist System (DCAS)** — an optional assist mode that buffers tag-in timing, slightly extending combo link windows and simplifying team execution.

## Player Impact Goals
- **Accessibility:** Reduce drop rate of beginner combos by 40%
- **Engagement:** Increase early match completion rate by 20%
- **Retention:** Improve Day 7 retention for new accounts using Assist Mode

## Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Source |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Combo drop rate | ↓ 40% | Match telemetry |
| Retention (Day 7) | +20% | Player analytics |
| Assist toggle usage | >50% | UX telemetry |

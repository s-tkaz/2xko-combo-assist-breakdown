# 2XKO Feature Breakdown – Dynamic Combo Assist System

A mock production breakdown for Riot Games’ *2XKO*, demonstrating how a Game Producer would plan, track, and deliver a new combat feature from prototype to live release.

## 🎯 Project Overview
- **Feature Goal:** Improve approachability for new players by adding an optional, timing-based Combo Assist system that helps execute tag combos more fluidly.
- **Game Context:** 2XKO – a tag-team fighting game emphasizing high-skill execution and team synergy.
- **Production Focus:** Scoping, scheduling, cross-discipline coordination, and Agile sprint planning.

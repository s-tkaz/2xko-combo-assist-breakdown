# Retrospective

## What Went Well
- Clear definition of player problem and measurable success criteria  
- Cross-discipline milestone mapping felt realistic and achievable  

## What Could Improve
- Could include localization & tutorial dependencies  
- Better QA integration earlier in prototyping  

## Learning Outcome
Planning even a small feature forces tradeoffs between ambition and delivery speed. This exercise helped me practice scope control and communication clarity — two key producer responsibilities.
